Lab Work
## 24/09/2025 Added Lab1 Thermometer 
## 05/Oct/2025 Added Lab2: HotelRoom & Rectangle 
## 09/oct/2025 Added lab3: Clock.java, the work is still not finished, but will be done by firday 10th oct 2025
## 12/oct/2025 Finished lab3: BankAccount + SavingsAccount
## 13/oct/2025 Added Lab4: Address class is finished, the rest of the objects need work
Something I just noticed is that I have, for example (street.isEmpty() || street == null), what I really should have is null value being checked first, before the isEmpty() method, and then have the null pointer exception. this will be fixed soon
